Kebran Alexander is a Democrat and dedicated public servant seeking election to Dallas City Council in the illustrious 4th District. He has resided in the District since the mid-1970s, when his parents moved their young family to a thriving neighborhood in the midst of integration. Working as a teacher and as a Department of Justice employee respectively, Kebran’s parents led by example and instilled in their children the importance of social justice & civic advocacy from a young age; the family was active in civil rights work throughout the ‘60s.

After earning a degree in political science from our own University of North Texas, Kebran excelled in corporate positions at both Crayola and IBM, but decided that public service spoke to his highest ambitions. He joined the Dallas County Elections Office in Community Support, and now serves in the Dallas County Sheriff's Office of Communications. Day in and day out, Kebran and his colleagues ensure through tireless work that vital public systems including 911 serve all Dallas residents. Recently, Kebran served at Dallas ISD as a substitute teacher & coach at South Oak Cliff High school. He has also proudly served as the District 4 Representative on the Dallas County Redistricting Commission by appointment of Councilmember emeritus King Arnold, and is currently First Vice President of the Dallas NAACP and recently served as a Board Member of the local League of Women Voters. 

As a lifelong resident and longtime public servant, Kebran Alexander is profoundly committed to the people of District 4. Our Key Priorities are more Equitable Housing, Better Infrastructure, Improved Quality of Life for all residents, and perhaps most importantly, Advocating for Our Constituents & their expressed goals. We humbly seek your support, your fellowship, and your vote for Kebran Alexander, Progressive Democrat for Dallas City Council, District 4.
