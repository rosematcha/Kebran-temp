 Given his long residence in the district and his career in public service, **Kebran Alexander has a clear view of the key issues District 4 is facing** and their attendant solutions. The communities of District 4 are amazing places to live primarily because of the people that call them home. Today, too many of our friends, family, and neighbors are being pushed out of the District and often Dallas altogether. Wage stagnation and generational poverty are major causes, and out-of-control costs of living, particularly skyrocketing rents, are exacerbating already-tough situations for many families in our District. As such, our core priorities for this Council District are *Equitable Housing, Better Infrastructure, Improved Quality of Life,* and last but certainly not least, *Advocating for Our Constituents* on their issues and goals.

 ## Housing Policy
Our goal is straightforward: **use policy levers and all resources available to the city to increase the supply and lower the cost of housing for Dallas residents,** especially in District 4. Kebran Alexander supports the proposed ban on algorithmic rent-setting, whereby property firms have rapidly & continuously increased housing costs in our community, as well as increased public housing assistance, stronger eviction protections & preventative measures, and augmented monitoring and enforcement with regard to housing discrimination. Furthermore, Alexander recognizes that zoning restrictions on new residential housing should be reassessed and better incentives for affordable housing construction need to be implemented. Finally, we want to explore municipal models employed by other Texan cities wherein partnerships with local community groups power new public housing.

## Infrastructure
District 4 needs 21st century upgrades to its roadways, utility lines, parks, pipes, and more. **Our residents deserve the very best,** our kids should feel like they have a future in our communities, and a strong foundation is key to attracting salutary investment over the long term. Decaying infrastructure threatens our safety and our livelihoods, the city can do better by all residents, and Kebran Alexander will work to see that our District gets its due share of municipal budget & bond allocations.

## Quality of Life
 By Quality of Life, we mean that all District 4 residents should have **safe, thriving communities** with high-quality food purveyors, public education, and healthcare facilities within easy reach. Good public schools with state of the art facilities must be kept in the district, and Kebran will maintain & strengthen our city’s collaboration with the local school districts to ensure District 4 youth are educated at the highest standards. **People should feel safe in and on the way to and from their homes.** Public safety personnel should be highly trained, and highly accountable to our residents. Dallas needs to ensure clinics, hospitals, and healthcare providers across the spectrum are available in each and every District, and the same goes for grocers’ and food vendors. No corner of Dallas should be without ready access to good schools, nutritious food, or necessary healthcare services.

 ## Advocating for Our Constitutents
  Finally, the first duty of any elected representative is to Advocate for their Constituents. That starts with listening to their concerns and aspirations, and **Kebran Alexander is committed to a transparent & highly interactive council office.** Our administration will make feedback easy and impactful, and we will make public comment at council meetings & other venues a priority. **District offices will be fully staffed and easily accessible** to deliver constituent services in a timely and efficient manner. We recognize that maintaining the faith & fidelity of those we represent is a daily process, an obligation to which we will be firmly dedicated from Day One on the job.

   Together, we can build a thriving, welcoming District, one where all residents feel dignified in their residence, secure in their community, & hopeful about the future of our city.
